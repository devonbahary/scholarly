With **[Scholarly](www.scholarly.cc)**, you can:

* Keep a **personalized list** of vocabularly words
* Access a **database** of definitions through **[Words API](https://www.wordsapi.com/docs)**
* Test yourself daily with short **quizzes** that push the words that escape you most


## Adding Vocab Words Is Easy

* Scholarly uses **[Words API](https://www.wordsapi.com/docs)** to pull definitions for your search queries.

* Words in **[Words API](https://www.wordsapi.com/docs)** are mapped to each other in a **network** that allows Scholarly to **make suggestions** for your vocabulary based on what you've already added.

* Can't find the right words? The right definition? **Fret not**, because..

## Create Your Own Definitions

## Add Words, Quiz Yourself, Repeat

* We only memorize what we repeatedly expose ourselves to, so put yourself **head-to-head** with those fancy words you've been stashing!

* **[Scholarly](www.scholarly.cc)** uses an **algorithm** that **prioritizes words you've got correct the least often**, but it doesn't forget to throw old familiar words at you as well.

* At the end of each quiz, you'll get the chance to **view your results**, **move on** to the next quiz, or **repeat** the same quiz.

* It's important to **minimize time in between quizzes**, so **[Scholarly](www.scholarly.cc)** will attempt to **build your next quiz in the background** whenever you're browsing the app.


## Personalize Your Experience
